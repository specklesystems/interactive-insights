#  Speckle - Interactive Insights workshop

This is the repo we will be using for the interactive insights workshop. It is not required to have this project running to follow the workshop. But if you want to follow along, or just play around with the viewer/code, you can clone this repo and run it locally.

For the workshop, we will be building a simple app on top of the Speckle Viewer. You can find the documentation [here](https://speckle.guide/viewer/).

##  Requirements
This demo project is built with Vue 3/TypeScript/Tailwind, but no tool-specific knowledge is required to follow the workshop. The viewer itself is framework agnostic.

#### Node
In order to run the project you need to have Node (22/LTS) installed.

#### IDE
You can use whichever IDE you prefer. Recommended is [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (disable Vetur).
